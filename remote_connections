# How to remotely connect to a Windows system

You will need credentails that have permission on that system or systems to connect remotley and run commands

One way 
Create a variable to store the credentails
$creds = Get-Credentails

This will initiat a log in window that you can type the daomain\login name and password

This will be stored as a string 
$creds
lab\administrator  System.security.SecureString

To use these stored credentials try the following

invoke-command -ComputerName DC01 -ScriptBlock {Get-Date} -Crednetial $creds

Second way
# Create a permanent commection to a or some servers
Enter-PSSesion -ComputerName DC01 -Credentail $creds
Or
PSSession -ComputerName DC01 -Credential (Get-Credential)

# Renember that when running command to remote systems it is serialized, meaning one runs then the next
# Consider creating a variable to aviod this
